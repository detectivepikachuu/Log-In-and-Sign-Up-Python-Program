# Log-In-and-Sign-Up-Python-Program
This is a very basic Log In and Sig Up program. It stores the password and email mixed together in a SHA-1 hash format in a separate file.

'UUID' and 'getpass' modules are imported
      UUID will encrypt the email mixed with the password in a .txt file
      getpass will hide the password when it is inputed during Log In and Sign Up

A 'useless_loop' will be set as true
      While this loop is True
            The user will be asked to enter a command (line 7)
